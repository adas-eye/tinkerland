<h2>AI (undergrad) Project #1: All The King's Horses</h2>
<h4>Due: January 17, 2011, 11:59 PM</h4>
</center>

In this project, you will write a program to play a game called
"All The King's Horses".  A number of versions of this game are
described in Conway's "On Numbers and Games", but we will play
one specific version not described exactly there.  
<p>
In this two-player game, each player has control of two chess
knights on a chessboard (which can be of any size).  On your turn,
you must move one of your knights toward the upper-left corner of
the board.  In general, this means that four moves are available:

<p>
 Of course, if a knight is near the top or left of the board, fewer
moves will be possible, and a knight in the upper left 2x2 area cannot
move at all.  For this reason, the board can be considered to extend
infinitely far down and to the right without the state space becoming
infinitely large.  In addition, a knight is not allowed to move to a
square occupied by another knight (of either color).  You lose the
game if you are unable to make a move.  As such, this game has no
draws.
<p>
For this project, you will write code in Lisp, Scheme or Python that
determines optimal moves for this game (in the minimax sense).  At a
minimum, you must produce a function <code>best-move</code> that takes
in a game representation (in some reasonable format) including which
player is to move, and returns the best possible next position after
that player's move.  You must also include a
function <code>play</code> that takes in a game representation and
plays out a whole game using your <code>best-move</code> function.<p>
In addition, you should write a depth-limited version
of <code>best-move</code> (call this <code>best-move-limited</code>)
that uses an evaluation function when the depth limit is reached.
This function should take a search depth and an evaluation function
as parameters in addition to the game state and player to move.
This will require writing a simple evaluation function as well,
anything reasonable is fine.
<p>
You must also include a writeup that describes your representation and
how your successor functions work.  You will not be graded explicitly on
this writeup, but it must be clear enough for me to appropriately grade
your code on efficiency and correctness.  Included in this, you must show
how to call <code>best-move</code> for the following game state with
black to move (and also for the same state with white to move):<p>

<p>
To submit your project, use the <code>submit</code> command on the
CS Unix machines, as follows:
<pre>
   submit zjb-grd proj1-ugrad <i>filename(s)</i>
</pre>
Note that <code>submit</code> will accept any filename(s) and does
no testing - and if your files are
successfully submitted, <code>submit</code> will not say anything!
Also, each submission completely overwrites any previous submission,
so if you choose to resubmit (which is fine), make sure to submit
all your files each time.
<p>
For implementation purposes, note that I will test your code on a 
CS Solaris machine, as follows: Lisp in <code>clisp</code>, Scheme
in <code>mzscheme</code> and Python in Python 3.1 (<code>python3</code>).
There should be little to no platform dependencies on anything we
do here, but make sure to try it on the CS installation just in case!
<p>
Your project grade will be assigned as follows:
<ul>
<li>Correctness and completeness of successor operations: 30%
<li>Correctness and completeness of exhaustive search procedure: 40%
<li>Correctness and completeness of limited-depth search (including
evaluation function): 15%
<li>Efficiency and clarity of code (especially state representation): 15%
</ul>
