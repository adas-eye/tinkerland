Description:
	Contained in this folder are practice programs I have created to better learn OpenCV
	and expand my knowledge of computer vision.



glcm.cpp
	This program constructs a Grey Level Co-Occurance matrix for an image and produces
	some statistics helpful in classifying objects. The program allows the user to
	explore an image by selecting regions to analyize and updating the GLCM and
	statistics as the user moves their mouse through the image.

	Key Actions:
		p	Pauses a video stream(Video not yet supported)
		r	Resets the region of interest
		s	Starts frame step mode for videos
		q	Quits

	Mouse Bindings:
		LButton	Click and drag to select a region of interest
		RButton Click and drag to move the region of interest

glcm-slow.cpp
	This program demonstrates how slow the library routines are for accessing an image's
	pixels directly. After noticing the speed improvment from hard coding an access routine
	for the specific type of IplImage needed it seems it would be best to write/use type
	specific access functions to boost performance in production.

motion.c
	This program simply displays the changed areas in an image due to motion. This is
	accomplished by differencing the current frame from the average of the past frames
	leaving only pixels that have changed.
